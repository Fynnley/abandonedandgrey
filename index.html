    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>Ready, set...</p>
    You have found yourself on the start page of my website.
    <p>My project investigates the concept of Liminal spaces. These are spaces that exist between one place/state and another, they are typically rather featureless and generally recognisable scenes that anyone could encounter. Typically they carry feelings such as disconcertion, calm, and nostalgia. Places where notions of liminality occur can be anywhere, but typically the space represents an inbetween, or sense of travel, therefore commonly associated are: hallways, petrol stations, open/unending roads, cemeteries, train stations, airports, bus stops, carriages, car interiors and phone booths, plus many more.
    Within settings such as these, when bare, the emptiness that liminality necessitates encourages negative feelings, this is where fear can strike, with the creepy, untouched, settings starts giving one a sense of impending doom. Alternatively filling the space lightly with familiar objects is grounding, making a setting feel lived in and temporary. The object as an artifact interacts with its surroundings to the effect of bringing peace to these transitional places.</p>
    <p>A space I chose as subject matter that can fulfill all of these requirements is that of an abandoned house. Familiar as a concept to all, as they can be found globally, they emit that sense of previous occupation that has since passed, a place that people once used until they moved to the next. Every object I have depicted could appear in these rooms.</p>
    <p>Additional to this and just as vital, while studying liminality within places we expect, I am simultaneously exploring ideas of digital liminality, given that enough time has elapsed for relics still hosted on the internet, to give an intense air of nostalgia. Let it be emphasised, the website you shall enter both hosts, and intrinsically is this project’s conclusion. I taught myself over the course of this semester how to code HTML and CSS from scratch. This is the language and styling I chose because this is the backbone of the 2000’s web, developed in 1993, it represents the foundations of the internet, as available to the general public. The website should, from its foundations, transport one back to the early personal blogging trend of the 90’s and early 2000’s. To invoke the bizarre, almost cryptic passages one may have found on those personal blogs, the project is aided by and contrasted with the use of AI generation text, as this is something I am highly interested in, and am exploring through essays in other courses. Please explore, and enjoy. :) </p>
